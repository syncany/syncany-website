This page accepts oauth redirection.  It passes the data in the hash on to localhost, which
is expected to be the Syncany application.  In many cases the oauth redirection can be sent
directly to Syncany on localhost, in which case this page is not needed.
However there are a couple of reasons why this may not be possible:

1. Hubic, for example, requires the redirection to be https.  Getting Syncany to listen
for https requests is not really possible because it would need a certificate.  If the certificate
is self-signed then the browser would give security warnings to the user which we don't want.
If the certificate is signed by a Certificate Authority then it can't go to localhost.

2. It may be that the oauth implementation does not allow redirection to localhost at all.

As the Syncany web site is https, we simply redirect oauth there, to this page.  This page then
redirects to localhost.

Syncany supports dynamic ports.  This is a good thing because we don't know which ports will
already be in use on a user's machine.  So we want to find an unused port.  For this reason and
for other reasons we do not want to hard-code the localhost redirect URL in the syncany.org redirect page.
Therefore the client adds a parameter 'syncanyredirect' to the OAuth redirect URL.  The redirect page at
syncany.org can then use this parameter to know where to redirect.
